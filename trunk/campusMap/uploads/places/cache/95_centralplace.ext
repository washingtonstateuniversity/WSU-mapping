The main library entrance on Terrell Mall serves both buildings (the libraries are also accessible directly from the CUB). Holland-Terrell is the University's main library. It holds more than 2 million books--including many rare and one-of-a-kind items in its Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections section--and provides access to nearly unlimited digital knowledge sources. Holland Library is a favorite place for students looking to study in quiet and solitude (and there's plenty of room for group study, too).</p>",
