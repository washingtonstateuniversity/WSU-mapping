Heald Hall holds classrooms, an auditorium, high-tech plant growth chambers, and the Ownbey Herbarium, which contains a botanical collection that reaches back to the days of Lewis and Clark. The building itself is one of the more unfortunate pieces of modernist architecture on campus, but it's what goes on inside that's important--and this awkward building is home to some of the University's best teaching and research.</p>",
