It also holds several lab classrooms where engineering students can get their hands on some of the same sophisticated equipment used by industry and academic researchers (aka their professors). Spacious and with plenty of natural light, ETRL is not just about machines and technology--it's a place made especially for *people* who invent machines and technology.</p>",
